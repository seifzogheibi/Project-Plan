int is_player_position_S(int x, int y){
    //start describing 

    // you want to do in this code

    //just using comments

    //and you basically tell amy

    //what she needs to do in the code

    //in this function
}

//do the same for diferent functions with different function names and then in the main function write comments that explain
//that you will call the different functions you defined but from the main() funciton


//do the same for typedef struct

//you can writr your comments the way you like( paragrphs or comments or cutted comments idk idc just do it)

//when you need just to define any variable you can do it as it is not actual code
//for e.g : 

#define rows 14;
#define cols 18;
//bas you put this in the beginning of your code , so only define and comments all over the codes.

//conclusion : this is fors writing functions and commenting every single one of them and explaining what she needs to implements if you give her this skeleton code you understand you piece of shit
